I have no idea why. Does this have to do with functions that are not just dealing with some sort of standard output? #rstats\"}\n\nMy first thought on reading this was that `View()` in RStudio is built to mask the `View()` function from utils, and so capitalizes the V because utils capitalized the V. Things are the way they are because they are the way they are, yet again.\n\nBut of course, that's not the actual question -- not only did David specify he's talking about the function in _R_, not in _RStudio_, but of course someone decided that utils should capitalize the `View()` function as well. And this is weird! There are not that many functions in base R that start with a capital letter:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetOption(\"defaultPackages\") |> \n  setdiff(\"datasets\") |> \n  vapply(\\(x) paste0(\"package:\", x), character(1)) |> \n  ls() |> \n  strsplit(\"\") |> \n  Filter(f = \\(x) x[[1]] %in% LETTERS) |> \n  vapply(paste0, character(1), collapse = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Rprof\"               \"Rprofmem\"            \"RShowDoc\"           \n [4] \"RSiteSearch\"         \"Rtangle\"             \"RtangleFinish\"      \n [7] \"RtangleRuncode\"      \"RtangleSetup\"        \"RtangleWritedoc\"    \n[10] \"RweaveChunkPrefix\"   \"RweaveEvalWithOpt\"   \"RweaveLatex\"        \n[13] \"RweaveLatexFinish\"   \"RweaveLatexOptions\"  \"RweaveLatexSetup\"   \n[16] \"RweaveLatexWritedoc\" \"RweaveTryStop\"       \"Stangle\"            \n[19] \"Sweave\"              \"SweaveHooks\"         \"SweaveSyntaxLatex\"  \n[22] \"SweaveSyntaxNoweb\"   \"SweaveSyntConv\"      \"URLdecode\"          \n[25] \"URLencode\"           \"View\"               \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese functions all follow one of three patterns:\n\n+ Functions that start with `R` or `S`, capitalized because it's the name of a programming language; \n+ Functions that start with URL;\n+ `View()` _by itself_!\n\nSo `View()` is weird; it's the only function that starts with a capital letter that's not named after a proper noun.^[[Merriam-Webster calls \"URL\" a noun](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/URL), even if it originated as an acronym, get out of my comments.] And it's been weird for a long time. The original version of the function was also capitalized when it was added by Professor Brian D Ripley way back in 2007:\n\n![](commit.png){fig-alt=\"Commit by Prof. Brian D Ripley on Feb 19 2007, adding the capitalized `View()` function.\"}\n\nNow here's where we enter the world of wild speculation. Because if we look at the documentation for `View()`, we can see that this function is meant to \"Invoke a Data Viewer\", with \"Data Viewer\" capitalized like a proper noun in both the function title and description:\n\n![](ViewDoc.png){fig-alt=\"The rd documentation file for `View()`. Notably, the Description field capitalizes the phrase Data Viewer.\"}\n\nThis isn't a universal style. If we look for instance at the documentation for `edit()`, which pre-dates `View()`,^[Though I'm not sure who originally wrote it; I get a bit lost in the VCS logs from before base functions were split into sub-packages.] we can see that \"text editor\" is capitalized in the title but not in the description:\n\n![](EditDoc.png){fig-alt=\"The rd documentation file for `edit()`. Notably, the Description field _does not_ capitalize the phrase text editor.\"}\n\nSo this makes me suspect that Data Viewer here is being used as a proper noun. This wouldn't be a unique usage; for instance, the [RStudio user guide also describes its viewer as a Data Viewer, capitalized](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/data/data-viewer.html), and a search for \"Data Viewer\" suggests the phrase is capitalized something like 2/3 of the time on public websites. I have absolutely no knowledge of the tech jargon of 2007, or of the proper styling of \"data viewer\",^[And I assume these two things are related!] but it does seem like it's _sometimes_ a proper noun.\n\nSo, to wildly speculate just a little further: is `View()` capitalized because \"Viewer\" was capitalized, at least back in 2007?\n\nNow, here's a decent piece of evidence _against_ this conjecture: the details section of the `View()` documentation, added at the same time as the title and description,^[And the function itself; all of this documentation is also still in the official help file.] doesn't capitalize the phrase \"data viewer\":\n\n![](ViewDetails.png){fig-alt=\"The details section of the `View()` documentation. Data viewer is not capitalized.\"}\n\nThat said, this is also not unique. That same [Rstudio user guide also sometimes writes \"data viewer\" in lowercase](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/data/data-viewer.html#scrolling), though in _most_ of the guide it's treated as a proper noun.\n\nSo there's one guess: maybe `View()` is capitalized because, like the functions starting with R and S and URL, it's named after a proper noun. Things are the way they are because they are the way they are, yet again.\n\nIf anyone knows more, though -- or feels like asking Professor Ripley -- please drop me a line. I'd love to know the actual answer.\n",
