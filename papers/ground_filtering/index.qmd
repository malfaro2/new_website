Airborne LiDAR has become an essential data source for large-scale, 
high-resolution modeling of forest biomass and carbon stocks, enabling 
predictions with much higher resolution and accuracy than can be achieved 
using optical imagery alone. Ground noise filtering -- that is, excluding 
returns from LiDAR point clouds based on simple height thresholds -- is a 
common practice meant to improve the 'signal' content of LiDAR returns by 
preventing ground returns from masking useful information about tree size and 
condition contained within canopy returns. Although this procedure originated 
in LiDAR-based estimation of mean tree and canopy height, ground noise 
filtering has remained prevalent in LiDAR pre-processing, even as modelers 
have shifted focus to forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and related 
characteristics for which ground returns may actually contain useful 
information about stand density and openness. In particular, ground returns 
may be helpful for making accurate biomass predictions in heterogeneous 
landscapes that include a patchy mosaic of vegetation heights and land cover 
types. 

In this paper, we applied several ground noise filtering thresholds while 
mapping two study areas in New York (USA), one a forest-dominated area and the 
other a mixed-use landscape. We observed that removing ground noise via any 
height threshold systematically biases many of the LiDAR-derived variables 
used in AGB modeling. By fitting random forest models to each of these 
predictor sets, we found that that ground noise filtering yields models of 
forest AGB with lower accuracy than models trained using predictors derived 
from unfiltered point clouds. The relative inferiority of AGB models based on 
filtered LiDAR returns was much greater for the mixed land-cover study area 
than for the contiguously forested study area. Our results suggest that ground 
filtering should be avoided when mapping biomass, particularly when mapping 
heterogeneous and highly patchy landscapes, as ground returns are more likely 
to represent useful 'signal' than extraneous 'noise' in these cases.

Filtering reduces the variance in many metrics, reducing the total amount of information available to models.
